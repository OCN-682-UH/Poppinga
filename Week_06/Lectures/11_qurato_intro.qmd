## What is Quarto?  

### Analyze. Share. Reproduce. You have a story to tell with dataâ€”tell it with Quarto.

## What is Quarto? {.smaller}


[**Quarto provides a unified authoring framework for data science, combining your code, its results, and your prose. Quarto documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, presentations, and more.**]{style="color:purple;"} 


::: {.fragment}

 1. For communicating to decision-makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.  
 
:::

::: {.fragment}

 2.  For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!), who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the code).  

:::

::: {.fragment}

 3. As an environment in which to do data science, as a modern-day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.

## What is inside?  

Quarto is broken into 4 major parts: 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
  - Metadata  
  - Text  
  - Code  
  - Output

::: {.column width="50%"}

*Before we code together I will walk you through some of the features. Then I will have you work with me.*

## Metadata: YAML {.smaller}

### YAML - *yet another markup language*

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
---
key: value
---

```

This goes at the top of your RMarkdown document, includes the metadata, style, and type of output for your document.

::: {.fragment}
You only need two pieces for it to work, but there is lots more to add to make it beautiful.


```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

title: "My Awesome Markdown File"
format: html
---
  
```

*title* is the title of your markdown document  
*format* is the format that it will be saved as

## Text

The text is written in the markdown language. You have already done a lab on markdown and this is the exact language that you use for your readme files. This is a short review.
