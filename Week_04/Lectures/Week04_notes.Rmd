# dplyr: verbs for manipulating data
![verbs](libs/images/dplyr_verbs.PNG)

filtering extracts rows
select() extracts columns
arrange() 
mutate() adds new columns, same length of rows but longer
group_by() %>% summarize() makes shorter

dplyr::filter()
call the package name first
filter(df, type == "otter" & site == "blah")

== reads as is exactly equal to

--
#Filter 
### Extract rows that meet some critera

```{r}
#filter(.data = DATA, ...)
```


* DATA = Data frame to transform  

* ... = One or more criteria  
filter() returns each row for which the criteria is TRUE

--
# filter only the female penguins
### As always, exact spelling and capitalization matters

Before filtering
```{r}
head(penguins)
```

--
# filter only the female penguins
### As always, exact spelling and capitalization matters

After filtering
```{r}
filter(.data = penguins, sex == "female" )
```
is sex exactly equal to female?
argument = .data

--
# filter

```{r}
filter(.data = penguins, 
       sex == "female" ) #filter keeps every TRUE
```

One = sets an argument in the function  

Two == reads as "is exactly equal to." It is a question that returns a TRUE or FALSE.  Here, filter keeps every TRUE

--
# A list of logical expressions 

![logicals](libs/images/logical_test.PNG)

Test Meaning
x < y less than
x > y greater than
== equal to (if you only have one thing to pull out)
x <= y less than or equal to
x >= y greater than or equal to
x != y not equal to (! can be used with anything)
x %in% y in group membership (pull out more than one thing, e.g is the species within the vector)
is.na(x) is missing
!is.na(x) is not missing (is it not an NA, if so retain it)

Note: these used universally in all coding languages

--
# How would I use filter to...

1. Penguins measured in the year 2008?
```{r}
filter(.data = penguins, 
       year == 2008)
```


2. Penguins that have a body mass greater than 5000
```{r}
filter(.data = penguins, 
       body_mass_g > 5000)
```


--

# Think, pair, share.  

Spend 2 minutes to *think* about it. Spend 2 minutes *paired* with a neighbor to discuss your answers. *Share* with the class.

--
# Common mistakes

## Using = instead of ==

```{r}
#filter(.data = penguins,
#  sex = "females")

filter(.data = penguins, 
       sex == "females")
```


## Forgetting quotes  

```{r}
#filter(.data == penguins, 
    #    sex == females) #for things that are characters

filter(.data = penguins, 
       sex == "females")
```
 

--

# Filter with multiple conditions

Select females that are also greater than 5000 g
comma means "and" --> do this and that
```{r}
filter(.data = penguins, sex == "female", body_mass_g >5000)

```


--
![operators](libs/images/operators.PNG)
Boolean operators
a & b --> and
a | b --> or
!a --> not

--
# Default for filter is **&**

These do the same exact thing
```{r}
filter(.data = penguins, sex == "female", body_mass_g >5000)

filter(.data = penguins, sex == "female" & body_mass_g >5000)

```

--

# Think, pair, share

Use filter and boolean logical to show:
#always need quotes for calling a character

1. Penguins that were collected in *either* 2008 *or* 2009
```{r}
filter(.data = penguins, year == 2008 | year == 2009)
```


2. Penguins that *are not* from the island Dream
```{r}
filter(.data = penguins, island != "Dream")
```


3. Penguins in the species Adelie and Gentoo
```{r}
filter(.data = penguins, species %in% c("Adelie","Gentoo"))
```


--
# Common mistakes

### Collapsing multiple tests into one 
penguins between 3000 and 5000 g
```{r}
#Wrong
#filter(.data = penguins,
 #      3000 < body_mass_g <5000) #

#Right
filter(.data = penguins, 
       body_mass_g <5000, #need to recall both 
       body_mass_g >3000) #can only have one logical statement per question

```

### Using multiple tests instead of %in%
penguins in dream and biscoe

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Wrong
filter(.data = penguins,
       island == "Dream", #<<
       island == "Biscoe") #<<

# Right
filter(.data = penguins,
       island %in% c("Dream","Biscoe")) #pull from within

```

# mutate: add new columns


<img src ="https://cdn.myportfolio.com/45214904-6a61-4e23-98d6-b140f8654a40/bd4ae264-ae51-4d18-bd60-7a058ab42fba_rw_1920.png?h=a3757d1f46f418c59e7e7946d026344e", width=70%/>

--
# mutate
![mutate](libs/images/mutate.PNG)

--
# mutate
*Create new columns*
mutate(.data,...)
* DATA = data frame to transform
* ... = columns to make
Add a new column converting body mass in g to kg and save the new dataframe

```{r}
data2<-mutate(.data = penguins, 
       body_mass_kg = body_mass_g/1000) #<<

View(data2)

```

--

### Change multiple columns at once
```{r}
data2<-mutate(.data = penguins, 
       body_mass_kg = body_mass_g/1000, #new column
       bill_length_depth = bill_length_mm/bill_depth_mm) #new column

# both data frames now within data2
# first line is convert mass to kg 
# second line is calculate the ratio of bill length to depth

View(data2)

```
--
## Mutating multiple columns at once based on some criteron (i.e. mutate all the numeric columns in one line)?

On your own, look up
* *mutate_if()* asks if its logical, eg log or squareroot everything
* *mutate_at()* selects specific variables
* *mutate_all()* mutates every single column in whatever way you want it to

[Some examples here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate_all.html)

--
![ifelse](libs/images/ifelse.PNG)
ifelse()
Do conditional tests within mutate()

ifelse(TEST,
      VALUE_IF_TRUE,
      VALUE_IF_FALSE)

* TEST = a logical test
* VALUE_IF_TRUE = what happens if test is true
* VALUE_IF_FALSE = what happensif test is false


--
# mutate with ifelse

```{r}
data2<- mutate(.data = penguins,
               after_2008 = ifelse(year>2008, "After 2008", "Before 2008"))
# if the word is greater than 2008, what 
View(data2)
```



--
# Think, pair, share

1. Use mutate to create a new column to add flipper length and body mass together
```{r}
data2<-mutate(penguins, 
      length_body_mass = flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g) 
view(data2)
```


2. Use mutate and ifelse to create a new column where body mass greater than 4000 is labeled as big and everything else is small 
```{r}
data2<- mutate(.data = penguins,
               big = ifelse(body_mass_g>4000, "big","small"))
view(data2)
```

# What if you have multiple verbs that you want to do to the same dataframe?

--

# The pipe  
# %>%

## The "pipe" says "and then do"

Dataframe %>%  # select the dataframe **and then** 
> verb1() %>%  # do verb 1 **and then** 

>verb2()      # do verb 2

--
# %>%


me %>%
  wake_up(time = "6:00") %>%
  music(turn = "on", to = "Beyonce") %>%
  shower(wash_hair = TRUE) %>%
  get_dressed(pants = TRUE, shirt = TRUE) %>%
  leave_house(car = TRUE)

--
# What about this new *native* pipe that I keep seeing on stack exchange?

# %>%   (need to load TidyVerse in order for it to run, more universal than native)
# vs  
# |> 

**magrittr** (from the tidyverse) vs **native** (new pipe that comes with base R so you don't need to load any libraries) 

In this class I stick with %>%, but you are welcome to learn and use |>, with the understanding that there will be some minor differences in the code.

[Please Read Here!](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform#sec-the-pipe)


--
# %>%

Filter only female penguins and add a new column that calculates the log body mass  
When you use %>% the dataframe carries over so you don't need to write it out anymore
* pipe and then new line, pipe and then new line, everything is connected

```{r}
penguins %>% # use penguin dataframe
  filter(sex == "female") %>% #select females
  mutate(log_mass = log(body_mass_g)) #calculate log biomass

```

--
# Select

Use select() to select certain columns to remain in the dataframe

```{r}
penguins %>% # use penguin dataframe
  filter(sex == "female") %>% #select females
  mutate(log_mass = log(body_mass_g)) %>% #calculate log biomass
  select(species, island, sex, log_mass)

```

--
# Select

You can also use select() to rename columns.  
Here, we are renaming species to have a capital S

```{r}
penguins %>% # use penguin dataframe
  filter(sex == "female") %>% #select females
  mutate(log_mass = log(body_mass_g)) %>% #calculate log biomass
  select(Species = species, island, sex, log_mass)

```
--
# Summarize 
 Computer a table of summarized data  
  Calculate the mean flipper length (and exclude any NAs)
 
```{r}
 penguins %>% # 
  summarise(mean_flipper = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)) #<<
```

--

Calculate mean and mean flipper length
 
```{r}
 penguins %>% # 
  summarise(mean_flipper = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE), #<<
            min_flipper = min(flipper_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE))   #<<
```

--
# group_by
You can summarize values by certain groups.  
group_by() by itself doesn't do anything, but it is powerful when put before summarize.
* use to make bar plots and standard errors in summary statistics

Let's calculate the mean and max bill length by island

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(island) %>% #<<
  summarise(mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_bill_length = max(bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE))
```

--
# group by
Groupe by multiple things
Group by both island **and** sex

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(island, sex) %>% #<<
  summarise(mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_bill_length = max(bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE))
#sumarise() has grouped output by 'island'. you can override using the 
# .groups argument
```


--
# remove NAs

drop_na() 
  - drops rows with NAs from a specific column

drop all the rows that are missing data on sex
```{r}
penguins %>%
  drop_na(sex) #<<

```
--
# remove NAs

drop_na() 
  - drops rows with NAs from a specific column
  - only use if you want to drop every single missing data from sex

drop all the rows that are missing data on sex
calculate mean bill length by sex

```{r}
penguins %>%
  drop_na(sex) %>%
  group_by(island, sex) %>% #cleans up NAs
  summarise(mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

```
--
# Pipe into a ggplot
You can connect your *data wrangling* to a ggplot with the pipe (you won't need to call the dataframe in ggplot if you pipe to it).
* pipe straight into ggplot

Drop NAs from sex, and then plot boxplots of flipper length by sex

```{r, fig.height=4}
penguins %>%
  drop_na(sex) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = flipper_length_mm)) + #go back to + when in ggplot
  geom_boxplot()
#if you assign something to this it'll be a plot not a data set

```

# Homework

Write a script that:

1. calculates the mean and variance of body mass by species, island, and sex without any NAs

1. filters out (i.e. excludes) male penguins, then calculates the log body mass, then selects only the columns for species, island, sex, and log body mass, then use these data to make any plot. Make sure the plot has clean and clear labels and follows best practices. Save the plot in the correct output folder.

Include both part 1 and part 2 in your script and push it to github in the appropriate folders.










--
# Homework

Using the chemistry data:
- Create a new clean script
- Remove all the NAs
- Separate the Tide_time column into appropriate columns for analysis
- Filter out a subset of data (your choice)
- use either pivot_longer or pivot_wider at least once
- Calculate some summary statistics (can be anything) and export the csv file into the output folder
- Make any kind of plot (it cannot be a boxplot) and export it into the output folder
- Make sure you comment your code and your data, outputs, and script are in the appropriate folders
