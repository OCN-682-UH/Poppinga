### Week 1a: In-Class Lecture
Forms of Data:
-	Athletic performance
-	Timeseries of polls
-	Sequence Data
-	Measurements of physical properties
-	Spatial data (e.g., Maps)
-	Timing of events
-	Images
-	Networks
-	Plain Text
-	So much more....

*Reproducible and Transparent data*
Import > Tidy > Understand: Transform/Visualize/Model > Communicate

Tidy Tuesday
-	Random data to plot (split it from our own serious data so we’re less scared)

GitHub
-	Everything will be on here

What is Data?
-	Characters
  * Letter or combo of letters enclosed by quotes
  * Alphabets or #s
  * Ex: “a”, “my name is”
* Numeric
  * Numbers that have a decimal value or are a fraction in nature have a data type as a numeric 
* Also called a “double”
o	Ex: 2.0, 14.5563
-	Integers
o	Numbers that do not contain decimal values have a data type as an integer
o	Ex: 1,2,3,4
-	Logical
o	A variable that can have a value of True and False
	Ex: TRUE, FALSE
-	Complex: 
o	An imaginary number
o	Ex: 1+4j
-	Factor: 
o	A data type that is used to refer to a qualitative relationship like colors, good & bad, course or movie ratings, etc. 
o	Useful in statistical modeling
o	Ex: “Good”, “Better”, “Best”

Structures
-	R Data Structures: Vector, List, Matrix, Dataframe
-	Homogenous (same data type)
o	Atomic vector (1D)
	Ex: 1, 2, 3
	Ex: [1] 9 1 3 6 
o	Matrix (2D)
	Column of integers or column of characters
o	Array (3D or ND)
	Multiple matrices on top of each other
	Micro CT: numbers that represent colors, etc.
-	Heterogenous (different data type)
o	List (1D)
o	DataFrame (Tibble) (2D)

What is R?
-	Open source
-	What is R Studio?
o	“R is a language and an environment for statistical computing and graphics”
o	R is a FREE program and completely open-source (you can see all the source code)
o	R is an object-oriented and functional language
o	Cant run R studio without having R on computer
o	Two ways to interact with R:
	Scripts: what you are going to do, top left
•	A place to create and save code. You can send the code that you write in a script to the console in a few different ways.
•	Write and _ code here
•	> means R is ready for you, if not here, R is processing something else 
•	+ means R is waiting for you to enter more data b/c it is missing something
•	<- means to assign an object
o	x <- 3 (anytime you type x, it will mean 3)
•	= will work for simple things but will cause problems with complex coding, so don’t use this
•	# used for comments, anything to right of # is ignored by R
o	Used to explain what you are doing
•	R is a literal language and cant read stuff if spelled wrong
o	Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation all matter. The computer only knows what you tell it and it assumes that you mean exactly what you say.
•	Functions are canned scripts
o	Automate something complicated or conviennt or both
o	Example: you can use the function sum() to add together a bunch of objects instead of writing out a long equation
	Sum(1,4,3)
	Plot(x,y) will create a simple plot
	Plot(1:5, 5:9)
•	? in front of a function and R will tell you what it is
•	Help.search() if looking for a function to do a task
•	Apropos(“”) when cant remember what it is called
•	Google stuff you don’t know
	Console: what you are currently doing, below scripts
•	the place where R is waiting for you to tell it what to do. You can type commands directly into the console, but the command will be forgotten once you close R.
•	Don’t type stuff here b/c it will disappear, use for tests
•	R as a calculator
o	Type stuff in here but it will not save
o	To save: answer <- 1+1 #saves it as an answer
o	Functions and equations
	Naming off of objects and saving
o	Environment: shows you what you already done (top right)
o	Working Directory: the folder you are working in (bottom right)
	Files, Libraries, and plots: where everything is stored
-	Benefits of using R: 
o	free, open-source, quality graphics
o	scripts to better look at exactly what was done
o	ask yourself why putting certain values for functions
o	good data management and manipulation capabilities
o	Reproducibility and transparency: R uses scripts instead of clicking on things with a mouse
o	You can write functions for specific needs
o	Google knows everything about R
-	Constraints: 
o	open source good and bad- know code well enough to know what’s good and what’s something junk that someone added
o	multiple functions do the same thing (which one is better for our purposes)

What is coding?
-	Directly telling the computer what to do
-	Manipulate exactly how you want
-	Script: multiple lines of code

### Week 1b Video Lecture: Collecting and Recording Data


Dimensions of your data.  
  -	# of complete observations. 
-	# of things measured per observation. 
-	Wide data. 
o	One observation per row and all the different variables and columns. 
	Ex: Unique sample id, treatment, 3 parameters. 
-	Long data
o	One unique measurement per row and all information about that measurement in same row
	Ex: sample id repeated, treatment, measurement type, values, units
-	DO NOT WANT: hybrid data

Metadata
-	Data about our data
o	Title and description
o	Tags and categories
o	Who last modified and when
o	Who can access or update
o	Units of measurement for each parameter
	Important for us
o	Notes associated with the collection
-	Use metadata in our lives ex: a picture, info about pixels
o	Books: cover, front page, etc.
-	What do you think is important metadata for your research?
o	Dates in same format as would put into spreadsheets
o	Start and end times 
o	Distance start and end
o	Location of research
	Coordinates?
o	Who is recording, who is sampling, etc.
o	Weather conditions
	Rainy/sunny/clouds, winds, tide, waves, current, temperature
o	For field sheet: emergency contacts, leaders, contact info
o	Notes about what we are doing (purpose), the surrounding crowd (people)
-	Required metadata for different biological databases
o	BCO-DMO (oceanographic data: Dataset metadata form )
o	NCBI (Sequence data/GenBank: GenBank metadata)
o	EML (Ecological metadata: EML Guide)
-	Creating a good data collection sheet
o	Missing things from the data sheet then we miss it in our analysis
o	How easy it to read?
o	Are column and row definitions clear?
o	Is there metadata?
o	How similar is it to your data entry sheet?
o	Can you use it at 4am?
o	Example
	Site name, description plant, date, time, personnel names, weather: % cloud cover, wind, humidity, temp, other notes
Making a data sheet for the field/lab
-	Keep in mind
o	Font size
o	Bolding is helpful
o	Well defined lines
o	Space to write down who took the data
o	When were the data taken
o	Where were the data taken
o	Sheet fit into one piece of paper
	All information for one unit of measurement should be on one sheet
	So not flipping sheet
o	Make more sense to have your sheet in landscape or portrait
o	Print/check how data sheet looks before its finalized, write on it to check
o	Enough space to write data into boxes
-	Some tips
o	Alternate white/gray shading to make it easier to match species to plots
o	Print the sheet and test it with both wide and long format
o	Ask someone not on the project to preview it and talk it over to make sure nothing is missing
o	Write dates and names of note-takers
o	Space for comments/observations
	Everything they want to remember about that day’s fieldwork
	Write it down or they will forget
o	Traceability of data as it is compiled and analyzed
o	Put finalized sheets on waterproof paper (b/c of rain)
-	Examples of not good field or lab data sheets
o	Voice recording data
	Keep a hard/original copy of everything
	Photos of that data sheet at end every single time

Paper: Browman and Woo (2017)
-	Creating good spreadsheets for analysis (from data collection sheet to analysis)
-	Tips
1)	Be consistent
2)	Choose good names
3)	Write dates as YYYY-MM-DD
4)	No empty cells
5)	Just put one thing in a cell
6)	Make it a rectangle
7)	Create a data dictionary
8)	No calculations in the raw data file
9)	Do not use color/highlights
10)	Make back-ups
11)	Use data validation to avoid errors
12)	Save as plain text
1)	Be consistent
a.	Use consistent terminology throughout
i.	Do: male/female; m/f; Male/Female
ii.	Do not: Male/female; M/female; or change throughout data sheet
b.	Use consistent variable names
i.	Do: High_treatment/Low_treatment; Glucose_6wk/Glucose_10wk
ii.	Don’t: High_treatment/Treatment_14C
c.	Be careful with spaces
i.	Copy and paste instead of typing each cell
ii.	Do not: “Site A” is different than “ Site A” and “Site A “
d.	Use consistent file names
i.	Data collected across multiple days and multiple sites
ii.	Easier to automate files that look like: 
1.	CondData_S32_011721.csv/ CondData_S32_011821.csv
2)	Choose good names
a.	Avoid space in names
i.	Site 1: Site_1 is best option instead of the space
ii.	Be careful about extra spaces at the beginning or end of a variable
b.	Do not use special characters
i.	$#@%&*^!?/(), etc.
ii.	These have different meanings in coding languages
iii.	Names short, but meaningful
c.	Never name a document as “final”
3)	Write dates in ISO 8601 Format
a.	YYYY-MM-DD  2025-08-29
b.	Excel can make lots of mistakes with different date formats
c.	Universal and everybody will understand what it means
4)	No empty cells in word doc
a.	Missing data and 0 mean very different things
i.	An empty box makes that info unknown
b.	If data are missing or not useful anymore put NA
c.	If there are 0 count of something put 0
d.	Do not leave it in blanks
5)	Put only one thing in each cell
a.	Plate example: instead of plate-well as “13_A01” 
i.	have one column for plate and one column for well (13, A01)
b.	don’t put units in your cells (important in data dictionaries)
i.	can have one column for value and one for the units
c.	don’t put notes within data column
i.	just put value and have another column for notes
6)	Make spreadsheets a rectangle
a.	One row for variable names on top and single row of headers
i.	Do not have multiple rows of headers
b.	Make every row an individual measurement (or subject or sample ID) and every column one unique variable
i.	Bad examples: mix of long and wide data format
c.	It is okay to have multiple rectangles, just put them on different spreadsheets
7)	Make a data dictionary
a.	Contains important metadata for your datasheet
b.	It should contain (at least): name, plot_name, description
i.	Exact variable name as in the data file
1.	Example: all columns in data file you can just copy and paste them in the first name column
ii.	A version of the variable name that might be used in data visualizations
1.	A “pretty” name or plot_name
2.	Can use capital letters, putting into actual plot
iii.	Longer explanation of what the variable means
1.	Description
a.	Define abbreviations here
2.	Can add “group” column too
a.	Time series or discrete/continuous
iv.	Measurement units
8)	NO calculations in your spreadsheets
a.	Calculations are not transparent data analysis
b.	Once your file is saved outside of excel (like a .csv) you may loose what those calculations are
c.	Will lead to major errors in data analysis that is not easily traceable
d.	All calculations should be within your code for true transparency
i.	If you do it in coding instead, you will know exactly what you did, when you did it, how you did it
9)	Do not use highlight or colors in spreadsheet
a.	Will also lose that information
b.	Example: an outlier is highlighted, will disappear in .csv format
i.	Instead of highlighting  add column that says outlier and put TRUE/FALSE
10)	Make back-ups
a.	Using an online repository called GitHub
b.	Can also use box, dropbox, or google drive
c.	Never have your data just on your harddrive
11)	Use data validation feature to avoid errors
a.	Set up rules for columns to make sure you don’t have a typo
b.	In excel
i.	Select a column
ii.	In the menu bar, choose Data  Validation
iii.	Choose appropriate validation criteria
1.	Whole number in some range
2.	Decimal number in some range
3.	List of possible values
4.	Text, but with a limit on length
iv.	An error will pop-up when typing if it is outside the range
12)	Save data as plain text file
a.	Always save spreadsheets as .csv
b.	Non-proprietary format that can be opened in any spreadsheet program

Examples
-	What is wrong with data sheet #1?
o	Everything has a highlight
o	Mixed long and wide format
o	Calculations in spreadsheet while also highlighted
o	Headers primarily have spaces instead of hyphens or underscores
o	Tide height name uses full word and doesn’t match the notation for it in parentheses in the title
-	What is wrong with data sheet #2?
o	Some things are highlighted
o	Mixed long and wide format
	June and august should be included as a column and not separated into two different formats
o	Has a mix of notations for missing data “x” and “-“ or just blank
o	Uses symbols in headers
-	What is wrong with data sheet #3?
o	Date is in wrong format and has blank cells below it
o	Time should also be repeated for every cell instead of blank
o	Calculations in the “total” column
o	Plots made on the same sheet—should be in a separate one
o	Lots and lots of blank cells which should have 0 or NA

Notes:
-	Can technically make anything a factor and R will order it
o	Order might not make sense to you
o	Factor and not a character
-	Ex: Factor for tide
o	Set levels to low, mid, high

Markdown Information:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
